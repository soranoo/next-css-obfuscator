### 🎉 Version 2.1.0 has NOW been released 🎉
  Shout out to [hoangnhan2ka3](https://github.com/hoangnhan2ka3) for providing a 💪wonderful [issue](https://github.com/soranoo/next-css-obfuscator/issues/6) report and a demo site. 

  #### 📌 Changes
  - Much Much Much better quality of CSS selector obfuscation
  - Delete original CSS automatically after obfuscation (only apply at full obfuscation)
  - Support TailwindCSS Universal Selector (eg. `*:pt-4`)
  - More tests

  #### 📌 Configuration Changes
  - Removed `customTailwindDarkModeSelector` option, the dark mode selector will be automatically obfuscated at full obfuscation.
  - Merged `includeAnyMatchRegexes` and `excludeAnyMatchRegexes` options into `whiteListedFolderPaths` and `blackListedFolderPaths` options. (Directly move the regexes to the `whiteListedFolderPaths` and `blackListedFolderPaths` options)
  - Added `removeOriginalCss` option, default to `false`. Set to `true` to delete original CSS from CSS files if it has a obfuscated version.
  - `classIgnore` option now supports Regex.

### 💥 Version 2 (Major Update)
  This version is deeply inspired by [PostCSS-Obfuscator](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D/postcss-obfuscator). Shout out to [n4j1Br4ch1D](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D) for creating such a great package and thank you [tremor](https://github.com/tremorlabs) for sponsoring this project.

  #### 📌 Changes
  - Support basic partial obfuscation
  - Support TailwindCSS Dark Mode
  - New configuration file `next-css-obfuscator.config.cjs`
  - More configuration options
  - Now become a independent solution (no need to patch `PostCSS-Obfuscator` anymore)
  - More tests
  - Better CSS parsing

## 🤔 Why this?

Because in the current version of [PostCSS-Obfuscator](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D/postcss-obfuscator) does not work with Next.js. (see [this issue](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D/postcss-obfuscator/issues/15) for more details)

## 💡 How does it work?

### Where is the issue in PostCSS-Obfuscator?

`PostCSS-Obfuscator` will not edit the build files instead it will create a new folder and put the obfuscated source code files in it. This is where the issue is. Next.js will not recognize the obfuscated files and will not include them in the build. I tried to point Nextjs to build the obfuscated files (by simply changing the obfuscated source code folder to `src`) but it didn't work.

### How does this package solve the issue?

Edit the build files directly. (It may not be the best solution but it works.)

### How does this package work?

1. Extract and parse CSS files from the build files.
2. Obfuscate the CSS selectors and save to a JSON file.
3. Search and replace the related class names in the build files with the obfuscated class names.

## 🗝️ Features

- WORK WITH NEXT.JS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> This package is NOT guaranteed to work with EVERYONE. Check the site carefully before using it in production.

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> As a trade-off, the obfuscation will make your CSS files larger.

## 🛠️ Development Environment

| Environment           | Version                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| OS                    | Windows 11 & Ubuntu 22.04 |
| Node.js               | v.18.17.1                 |
| NPM                   | v.10.1.0                  |
| Next.js (Page Router) | v.13.5.4 & v.13.4.1       |
| Next.js (App Router)  | v.14.0.4                  |
| TailwindCSS           | v.3.3.3                   |

- ✅ Tested and works with Next.js Page Router and App Router.
- ✅ Tested and works with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

(Theoretically it supports all CSS frameworks but I only tested it with TailwindCSS.)

## 📦 Requirements

- ⌛ TIME 🕛

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install -D  next-css-obfuscator
```

Visit the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-css-obfuscator) page.

### Setup

1. Create and add the following code to `next-css-obfuscator.config.cjs` or `next-css-obfuscator.config.ts`:

    ##### Obfuscate all files
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        enable: true,
        mode: "random", // random | simplify | simplify-seedable
        refreshClassConversionJson: false, // recommended set to true if not in production
        allowExtensions: [".jsx", ".tsx", ".js", ".ts", ".html", ".rsc"],
      };

    ```
    ##### Partially obfuscate
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        enable: true,
        mode: "random", // random | simplify | simplify-seedable
        refreshClassConversionJson: false, // recommended set to true if not in production
        allowExtensions: [".jsx", ".tsx", ".js", ".ts", ".html", ".rsc"],

        enableMarkers: true,
      };

    ```

    ##### TypeScript
    ```ts
    import { Options } from "next-css-obfuscator";

    module.exports = {
      // other options ...
    } as Options;
    ```



    Feel free to checkout [📖 Config Options Reference](#-config-options-reference) for more options and details.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The obfuscation will never work as expected, tweak the options with your own needs.

2. Add the following code to `package.json`:

   ```javascript
   "scripts": {
    // other scripts ...
    "obfuscate-build": "next-css-obfuscator"
    },
   ```

   Read [💻 CLI](#-cli) for more details.

### Usage 🎉

1. Run `npm run build` to build the project.
2. Run `npm run obfuscate-build` to obfuscate the css files.

(You may need to delete the `.next/cache` folder before running `npm run start` to make sure the obfuscation takes effect. And don't forget to `shift + F5` refresh the page.`)

> [!WARNING]\
> NEVER run `obfuscate-build` twice in a row. It may mess up the build files and the obfuscation conversion table. You can remove the `classConversionJsonFolderPath`(default: `css-obfuscator`) folder to reset the conversion table.

> [!NOTE]\
> For better development experience, it is recommended to enable `refreshClassConversionJson` option in `next-css-obfuscator.config.cjs` and disable it in production.

For convenience, you may update your build script to:

```javascript
// package.json

"scripts": {
  // other scripts ...
  "build": "next build && npm run obfuscate-build"
},
```

to make sure the build is always obfuscated and no need to run `obfuscate-build` manually.

> [!NOTE]\
> It is a good idea to add the `/css-obfuscator` folder to `.gitignore` to prevent the conversion table from being uploaded to the repository.

#### Partially obfuscate
To partially obfuscate your project, you have to add the obfuscate marker class to the components you want to obfuscate.

```diff
// example

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-[#fac3e3] to-[#5c9cbd] text-white">
      <div className="container flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-12 px-4 py-16 ">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-[5rem]">
          Next14 App Router
        </h1>
      </div>
-     <div className="container flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-12 px-4 py-16 ">
+     <div className="next-css-obfuscation container flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-12 px-4 py-16 ">
        <span className="text-2xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-700 border-2 border-blue-950 rounded-lg p-4">
          My classes are obfuscated
        </span>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

See [Next 14 App Router Partially Obfuscated Demo](https://github.com/soranoo/next-css-obfuscator/tree/main/demos/next14-app-router-partially-obfuscated) for more details.

## 🔧 My Setting

If you are interested in my setting (from my production site), here it is

```javascript
// next-css-obfuscator.config.cjs

module.exports = {
  enable: true,
  mode: "random", // random | simplify | simplify-seedable
  refreshClassConversionJson: false, // recommended set to true if not in production
  allowExtensions: [".jsx", ".tsx", ".js", ".ts", ".html", ".rsc"],

  blackListedFolderPaths: [
    "./.next/cache",
    /\.next\/server\/pages\/api/,
    /_document..*js/,
    /_app-.*/,
    /__.*/, // <= maybe helpful if you are using Next.js Local Fonts [1*]
  ],
};
```
[*1] See this [comment](https://github.com/soranoo/next-css-obfuscator/issues/6#issuecomment-1919495298)

It may not be the best setting but it works for me. :)

## 💡 Tips

### 1. Not work at Vercel after updated ?

If you are using this package with Vercel, you may find the package does not work as expected after being updated. This is because Vercel will cache the last build for a faster build time. To fix this you have to redeploy with the `Use existing build cache` option disabled.

### 2. Lazy Setup - Obfuscate all files

Enable `enableMarkers` and put the obfuscate marker class at every component included the index page. But if you want to set and forget, you must play with the options to ensure the obfuscation works as expected.

### 3. It was working normally just now, but not now?

Your conversion table may be messed up. Try to delete the `classConversionJsonFolderPath`(default: `css-obfuscator`) folder to reset the conversion table.

### 4. Why are some original selectors still in the obfuscated CSS file even the `removeOriginalCss` option is set to `true`?

In a normal situation, the package will only remove the original CSS that is related to the obfuscation and you should not see any CSS sharing the same declaration block.

You are not expected to see this:
```css
/* example.css */

/* original form */
.text-stone-300 {
  --tw-text-opacity: 1;
  color: rgb(214 211 209 / var(--tw-text-opacity));
}

/* obfuscated form */
.d8964 {
  --tw-text-opacity: 1;
  color: rgb(214 211 209 / var(--tw-text-opacity));
}
```
But this:
```css
/* example.css */

/* obfuscated form */
.d8964 {
  --tw-text-opacity: 1;
  color: rgb(214 211 209 / var(--tw-text-opacity));
}
```

If you encounter the first situation, it means something is wrong with the obfuscation. You may need to raise an [issue](https://github.com/soranoo/next-css-obfuscator/issues) with your configuration and the related code.

### 5. Why did I get a copy of the original CSS after partial obfuscation?

Since the original CSS may be referenced by other components not included in the obfuscation, the package will not remove the original CSS to prevent breaking the the site.

### 6. How to deal with CSS cache in PaaS like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)?

(I will take [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as an example)

You may discover that the obfuscated class conversion table updates every time you deploy your site to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) even if the `refreshClassConversionJson` option is set to `false`. As a result, the CSS file will update in every deployment and break the CDN cache. This is because [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) will not keep the files generated by the previous deployment. To fix this, you can simply provide a fixed `generatorSeed` to make sure the obfuscated class name will be the same as the previous.

### 7. When to use `enableJsAst`?

~~If you are going to partially obfuscate your site, you may want to enable this option to obfuscate. It gives the ability to trace the variable that is related to the class name in a JS file which the normal basic partial obfuscation can't do.~~ (WIP)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that if a shared component is under the obfuscation marker, that component will be obfuscated and may affect other components(with no obfuscation marker) that use the same shared component.

If you are going to obfuscate the whole site, you will get a way more accurate obfuscation by enabling this option without putting a ton of time into tweaking the options.

> [!NOTE]
> As a trade-off, this will take more time to obfuscate.

> [!NOTE]
> This method can only trace the variable within the same JS file. It can't trace the variable that is imported from another file.

## ⭐ TODO

- [x] Partial obfuscation
- [x] To be a totally independent package (remove dependency on [PostCSS-Obfuscator](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D/postcss-obfuscato))
- [ ] More tests
- [ ] More demos ?

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] Partial Obfuscation
  - Not work with complex components. (eg. A component with shared component(s))
    - Reason: The obfuscation marker can't locate the correct code block to obfuscate.
  - Potential Solution: track the function/variable call stack to locate the correct code block to obfuscate.
