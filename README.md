### üéâ Version 2 has NOW been released üéâ
  This version is deeply inspired by [PostCSS-Obfuscator](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D/postcss-obfuscator). Shout out to [n4j1Br4ch1D](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D) for creating such a great package and thank you [tremor](https://github.com/tremorlabs) for sponsoring this project.

  #### Changes:
  - Support partially obfuscation
  - Support TailwindCSS Dark Mode
  - New configuration file `next-css-obfuscator.config.cjs`
  - More configuration options
  - Now become a independent sulotion (no need to patch `PostCSS-Obfuscator` anymore)
  - More tests
  - Better CSS parsing
  
  #### Migration Guide:
  - [Migrate from version 1.x to 2.x](docs/upgrade-to-v2.md)


[version 1.x README](https://github.com/soranoo/next-css-obfuscator/tree/v.1.1.0)

## ü§î Why this?

Because in the current version of [PostCSS-Obfuscator](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D/postcss-obfuscator) does not work with Next.js. (see [this issue](https://github.com/n4j1Br4ch1D/postcss-obfuscator/issues/15) for more details)

## üí° How does it work?

### Where is issue in PostCSS-Obfuscator?

`PostCSS-Obfuscator` will not edit the build files instead it will create a new folder and put the obfuscated source code files in it. This is where the issue is. Next.js will not recognize the obfuscated files and will not include them in the build. I tried to point Nextjs to build the obfuscated files (by simply change the obfuscated source code folder to `src`) but it didn't work.

### How does this package solve the issue?

Edit the build files directly. (It may not be the best solution but it works.)

### How does this package work?

1. Extract and parse CSS files from the build files.
2. Obfuscate the CSS selectors and save to a JSON file.
3. Search and replace the related class names in the build files with the obfuscated class names.

## üóùÔ∏è Features

- WORK WITH NEXT.JS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

> [!NOTE]\
> This package is NOT guaranteed to work with EVERYONE. Check the site carefully before using it in production.

> [!WARNING]\
> As a trade-off, the obfuscation will make your CSS files larger.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

| Environment           | Version                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| OS                    | Windows 11 & Ubuntu 22.04 |
| Node.js               | v.18.17.1                 |
| NPM                   | v.10.1.0                  |
| Next.js (Page Router) | v.13.5.4 & v.13.4.1       |
| Next.js (App Router)  | v.14.0.4                  |
| TailwindCSS           | v.3.3.3                   |

- ‚úÖ Tested and works with Next.js Page Router and App Router.
- ‚úÖ Tested and works with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

(Theoretically it supports all CSS frameworks but I only tested it with TailwindCSS.)

<!-- ## üì¶ Requirements

-  -->

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install -D  next-css-obfuscator
```

Visit the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-css-obfuscator) page.

### Setup

1. Create and add the following code to `next-css-obfuscator.config.cjs` or `next-css-obfuscator.config.ts`:

    ##### Obfuscate all files
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        enable: true,
        mode: "random", // random | simplify
        refreshClassConversionJson: false, // recommended set to true if not in production
        allowExtensions: [".jsx", ".tsx", ".js", ".ts", ".html", ".rsc"],
      };

    ```
    ##### Partially obfuscate
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        enable: true,
        mode: "random", // random | simplify
        refreshClassConversionJson: false, // recommended set to true if not in production
        allowExtensions: [".jsx", ".tsx", ".js", ".ts", ".html", ".rsc"],

        enableMarkers: true,
      };

    ```

    ##### TypeScript
    ```ts
    import { Options } from "next-css-obfuscator";

    module.exports = {
      // other options ...
    } as Options;
    ```



    Feel free to checkout [üìñ PostCSS Options Reference](#-postcss-options-reference) for more options and details.

    > [!NOTE]\
    > The obfuscation will never work as expected, tweak the options with your own needs.

2. Add the following code to `package.json`:

   ```javascript
   "scripts": {
    // other scripts ...
    "obfuscate-build": "next-css-obfuscator"
    },
   ```

   Read [üíª CLI](#-cli) for more details.

### Usage üéâ

1. Run `npm run build` to build the project.
2. Run `npm run obfuscate-build` to obfuscate the css files.

(You may need to delete the `.next/cache` folder before running `npm run start` to make sure the obfuscation takes effect. And don't forget to `shift + F5` refresh the page.`)

> [!WARNING]\
> NEVER run `obfuscate-build` twice in a row. It may mess up the build files and obfuscation convertion table. You can remove the `classConversionJsonFolderPath`(default: `css-obfuscator`) folder to reset the convertion table.

> [!NOTE]\
> For better development experience, it is recommanded to enable `refreshClassConversionJson` option in `next-css-obfuscator.config.cjs` and disable it in production.

For convenience, you may update your build script to:

```javascript
// package.json

"scripts": {
  // other scripts ...
  "build": "next build && npm run obfuscate-build"
},
```

to make sure the build is always obfuscated and no need to run `obfuscate-build` manually.

#### Partially obfuscate
To partially obfuscate your project, you have to add the obfuscate marker class to the components you want to obfuscate.

```diff
// example

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-[#fac3e3] to-[#5c9cbd] text-white">
      <div className="container flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-12 px-4 py-16 ">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-[5rem]">
          Next14 App Router
        </h1>
      </div>
-     <div className="container flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-12 px-4 py-16 ">
+     <div className="next-css-obfuscation container flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-12 px-4 py-16 ">
        <span className="text-2xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-700 border-2 border-blue-950 rounded-lg p-4">
          My classes are obfuscated
        </span>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

See [Next 14 App Router Partially Obfuscated Demo](https://github.com/soranoo/next-css-obfuscator/tree/main/demo/next14-app-router-partially-obfuscated) for more details.

## üîß My Setting

If you are interested in my setting (from my production site), here it is

```javascript
// next-css-obfuscator.config.cjs

module.exports = {
  enable: true,
  mode: "random", // random | simplify
  refreshClassConversionJson: false, // recommended set to true if not in production
  allowExtensions: [".jsx", ".tsx", ".js", ".ts", ".html", ".rsc"],

  blackListedFolderPaths: ["./.next/cache"],
  excludeAnyMatchRegexes: [
    /\.next\/server\/pages\/api/,
    /_document..*js/,
    /_app-.*/,
  ],
  customTailwindDarkModeSelector: "dm",
};
```

It may not be the best setting but it works for me. :)

## üíª CLI

```

## üí° Tips

### 1. Not work at Vercel after updated ?

If you are using this package with Vercel, you may found the package not work as expected after updated. This is because Vercel will cache the last build for a faster build time. To fix this you have to redeploy with the `Use existing build cache` option disabled.

### 2. Lazy Setup - Obfuscate all files

Enable `enableMarkers` and put the obfuscate marker class at every component included the index page. But if you want to set and forget, you must play with the options to ensure the obfuscation works as expected.

### 3. It was working normally just now, but not now?

Your convertion table may be messed up. Try to delete the `classConversionJsonFolderPath`(default: `css-obfuscator`) folder to reset the convertion table.
